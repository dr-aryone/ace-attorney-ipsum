"You just had a burger!",
"Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!",
"(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)",
"Look, a ladder!",
"That's a 'step'-ladder.",
"So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!",

"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!",
"Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...",

"YOUR NAME, PLEASE!",
"(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)",
"Wendy Oldbag, dearie.",
"So just call me 'grandma.' It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and whene called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--",
"O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.",
"Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.",
"You let 'em have it, Edgey-boy!",
"(E-Edgey-boy...?)",
"(After presenting any evidence other than Powers' Photo) I try not to pay much attention to things that don't interest me. LOL.",
"W-why are you staring at me like that...?",
"What the hell do samurais sing about? Chopping off heads?",
"Wrong, Mr. Wright.",
"I know you well enough by now to know when you're going to present the wrong evidence.",
"I can sense it too, with my Fey blood...",
"(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!)",
"I was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk.",
"I was hoping to come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor...",
"How is Edgeworth doing, anyway?",
"Edgeworth is out of control! He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it.",
"Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!",
"Witness, you've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.",
"I set my ATM card's number to '0001' because I'm number one!",
"So what? My granddaughter has a dog she calls Phoenix! Well, Mr Phoenix Wright? Does that make you my grand-daughter's fiancée?! She's only seven years old!",
"This photo is worth a thousand words… and they all read 'guilty'!",
"I've heard of desperate men grasping at straws, but this is the first time I've heard of men grasping at macaws! Hah!",
"Objection! Sustained!",
"Mr. Wright. You are truly the most unpredictable defense attorney I've ever known. I can tell you're grasping, yet I cannot deny the possibility of what you say.",
"I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!",
"… Oh… Is that part of your spirit medium training?",
"Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately… I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!",
"Umm… Okay…... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...",
"Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?",
"The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.",
"...You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?",
"(Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm…)",
"The fireman yelled at me when I called him…",
"So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?",
"Nick… Should we be laughing?",
"Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad… or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.",
"… I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.",
"Oh, it's Christmas today! I forgot! What are you getting for me for Christmas, Nick?",
"Talk to Santa.",
"I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today...",
"*sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?",
"I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.",
"(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)",
"(Looking at the noise-activated camera) Let's try it out! Hi! I'm Nick!",
"Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. HEY! I'M NICK!!!",
"Huh. NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!",
"D-Don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set to respond to voices?",
"Long time no see, Nick.",
"Nick… you know Santa? Wow… Nick and St. Nick… Hey! I see the connection!",
"(It must hurt, to be ignored by a bird...)",
"Witness! You can't just say 'hello' and expect us to get anywhere! I want you to testify!",
"Do you know what happened here?",
"Huh? You don't know, pal?",
"Wow, okay, Mr. head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.",
"Head-in-the... huh?",
"Never mind, I'll tell you.",
"Mr Edgeworth's sighs smell like citrus fruit.",
"(looking at a chessboard) And check out that poor pawn, his head is kind of spiky... Kind of reminds me of you.",
"Maybe Edgeworth took his unholy revenge on the detectives and slapped somebody!",
"Hey! I used to take Organ lessons! They called me 'Little Miss Bach' in Kindergarten. Of course, that was before I learnt to play any notes. *single organ note* I never could remember where 'C' was...",
"So does that mean if I order Pizza, I'm planning to kill the delivery boy?",
"So that's why everyone craves about caviar! It's so tasty it hurts!",
"The prosecution will wait... I'm not finished eating.",
"I spent a whole day looking for my dentures. They turned out to be in my mouth all along.",
"This piece of evidence indeed seems to contradict something... like your outward appearance of mental sanity!!! [Judge penalizes Phoenix]",
"Why do I come here to the office every day ? It's not like I want to work.",
"What's this ? It looks like a shield of some kind... It's broken. Maybe it's made out of chocolate, and he [Edgeworth] took a bite out of it.",
"(Leave it at that!? This is a murder case people!)",
"A 'human machine'!? That's a contradiction!",
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to plan a murder, you don't forget the weapon!",
"No one can change the past. The only thing we can do is strive to make up for our mistakes. Why must we make up for our mistakes, you ask? Because in so doing... we can find the way back to our path. And once we've found our path, we can move on from our past mistakes toward a brighter future.",
"Our job is to find truth, no matter how painful it may be.",
"When you've run into a wall with no place to go, return to the basics.",
"...You can wipe that foolish grin off your face now, Wright!",
"Just remember one thing, Mr. Wright. Every time you point your finger, someone gets hurt.",
"When a detective screws up, the Chief calls him to his office... and makes him listen to the organ for hours. (...) After that, the detective can't hear anything for days except for the ringing in his ears.",
"'When there's gunshots, there's bound to be bullets.'",
"You know, I got a 97 on my Science test the other day!",
"(Too bad they don't have a test for common sense.)",
"All you need [To re-decorate your office as Edgeworth's] is money and a little of design sense.",
"I'm not doing so well in either of those areas.",
"What the hell was that wriggling piece of plywood!?",
"Sir! That is the pride and joy of the entire Criminal Affairs Department, sir! It's the Blue Badger, sir!",
"There is a jacket framed on the wall like a painting ! The fabric is high-grade cashmere... Italian styling... Silk ruffles, turquoise buttons, and a gold thread collar. I'm guessing it's worth around $5,000.",
"Speaking of which, your suit would be about...",
"Were you to jump out this window, the time until the impact with the ground would be... ... Got it ! Approximately 3.23 seconds!",
"There you are! Where have you been? My sister's trial is tomorrow!",
"It doesn't matter who I am, it matters who YOU are! You're the famous defense attorney Mia Fey!",
"…Oh! You're not Mia Fey are you?",
"I'm sorry. Mia Fey no longer… works here.",
"So you are… the coffee boy?",
"I'm Phoenix Wright, defense attorney.",
"(writing notes) Wright… Wright… Wait! You mean THE Phoenix Wright. The Phoenix Wright from the Edgeworth murder case?",
"Um, yeah sure. (It wasn't Edgeworth who got murdered though…)",
"Phew… that's a relief. You're better than nobody.",
"I promised my sister I'd bring her Mia Fey but…",
"Incidentally, Mia was a woman.",
"Yeah, I thought you looked a bit strange when I first saw you.",
"See this? It's my Attorney's Badge.",
"(You're the first one who's actually been interested in mine, believe me.)",
"Its composition is mostly silver. The gold plating is flaking a bit.",
"She analyzed it. Scientifically...)",
"There doesn't appear to be any corrosion due to sulfides. I'd give you $50.00 for it.",
"Sorry, but it's not for sale. Yet...",
"They kicked me out of Criminal Affairs...",
"Detective Gumshoe! What did you do this time?",
"(To Angel Starr) Hmm? Haven't I seen you somewhere...?",
"(Show him a caviar lunch box) You ordered the Caviar Lunch, right?",
"Ho Ho! Caviar! I've never eaten caviar before!",
"(The judge is really wolfing it down...)",
"Well, Your Honor? How does it taste?",
"So this is why everyone raves about caviar! It's so tasty it hurts! I always thought caviar would taste like pickled tapioca.",
"(What the heck does pickled tapioca taste like?!)",
"Very well, witness. Please describe the incident to us.",
"The prosecution will wait! I'm not finished eating yet...",
"Lana Skye intended to murder Detective Goodman!",
"*Hold it!* You've said that, but you haven't told us how you know!",
"That's what I'm about to tell you Rookie!",
"I believe what she just said was a mere prelude to the story she is about to tell. Try not to interrupt her again.",
"Rookie... Never interrupt a storyteller! It's like pulling a bun out of the over half-baked!",
"(Something's half-baked here alright, and it's you!)",
"What kind of 'grudge'!?",
"Of course you don't! That's because she didn't have a grudge!",
"Rookie... I have a lunchbox here. Now... what's inside?",
"H-How am I supposed to know!?",
"See? We agree there is a lunchbox here, but we don't know what's inside! A person's life is like a lunchbox with pretzels. Don't you agree?",
"I-I get it! That's why my lunch was so salty!",
"(This judge isn't very good with metaphors...)",
"Will the witness please state his name and occupation.",
"Yes sir! I am Officer Mike Meekins, sir! My occupation is, um... that would be murderer, sir.",
"Er... so you're telling us you're a 'professional killer...'",
"Sir. It was me, sir! I'm the one who did it! I'll never kill anyone again, sir! You've got to believe me, sir!",
"Uh... actually, what I'd like to hear from you is...",
"Sir! I'm part of what you would call the younger generation, sir! A person whose actions adults can't possibly comprehend!",
"Please, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Help me, sir!",
"I'd appreciate it if you'd stop making these ridiculous allegations.",
"Yes, you do have a point... You wouldn't have the guts to do something like that...",
"What? I'll have you know back in the day, I once broke into a cattle ranch and tipped -",
"Mr Wright! What are you saying?!",
"He would be able to use the Chief Prosecutor as his puppet!",
"Essentially... he would acquire unchecked authority over all investigations!",
"Do you mean to tell me... that despite the Chief's formidable appearance, he plays with puppets!?",
"Oh, wait. You must mean 'puppet' as in someone forced to do his bidding... Nevermind!",
"The question is, if he did arrive there first, why did he hide that fact for two years!?",
"Well, Your Honor? Can you answer us that!?",
"Nnnnn...NNNNGHAAAAAAA!",
"Noooooooooooo!",
"Wait, I'm not the one on trial here!",
"This is a message from the deceased!",
"Right...now, this is a message from the Judge!",
"Doesn't it look delicious? Care for a bite?",
"(Nowhere to run... I'm sooo dead!)",
"So, my name is 'Phoenix Wright'? What a weird name.",
"(Recalling his friends and picturing Winston Payne) ...This person... I haven't got a clue. He seems to know me but maybe he's mistaking me for someone else?",
"Earth to Nick! What's the matter?",
"You know you're awfully forgetful these days Nick. I hope I never get to be a forgetful old prune like you.",
"Come on Nick. We can talk about you being old later.",
"What's wrong? You've been staring at me for a while. You're kind of scaring me sir.",
"(Hmm, I'm afraid to ask but here goes.) So this might sound bad but... who are you?",
"I heard you can fix something like this with a really strong shock to your system! Come on, lower your head a little! A Maggey Kick should be all you need!",
"Come on!... Ah, I'm sorry. Whenever I see someone in trouble, I have a hard time leaving them alone... I tend to stick my nose where it doesn't belong and try to tackle everyone's problems.",
"(Well, my head's one problem you won't be tackling today...)",
"Hee Hee Hee... It's been a while, hasn't it, Mr. Wright. Let's see what you've learnt since last time. (shows confidence) I will show you no mercy this time, rookie!",
"...Okaaay. (And who are you again?)",
"'OBJECTION!!!..............What...What's come over me? Without thinking, I just blurted out 'Objection!'...And I yelled it at the﻿ top of my lungs, finger outstretched, ready to take on my opponent!...What a rush!'",
"Fashion! Cars! Women! Glasses! And of course... University! First-rates need only apply!",
"Could you tell the court what is special about this glove?",
"What's special? Never really thought about it but... it's REALLY yellow... and that's about it.",
"His pointer finger?",
"You know, the one you're always POINTING and waving around in people's faces.",
"Aha, ha, ha. Don't tell me it bothers you...",
"Every time you do it, I have a mini-heart attack. It's like you're trying to kill me, pal.",
"The name on that card tells people who I am!",
"It even told ME that I'm 'Phoenix Wright'!",
"OBJECTION! Wh-what's the meaning of this nonsense?!",
"Mr Wright! Get a hold of yourself and start acting like a proper lawyer!",
"Ouch! Talk about a tongue-lashing, Nick.",
"Mr. Wellington loves large bananas!",
"Uh, Nick... I hope you've noticed the icy glares we're getting from everyone in here!",
"Wh-What in the world do you mean?",
"I'll have you know I like strawberries much better than bananas.",
"Ah, I remember when I was young and in love. Oh, it was a jolly time.",
"(Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...)",
"(When being asked if he wants to hear the Ini Miney's story again)",
"(Well excuuuse me, Princess. ...Anyway, should I ask to hear the story again...?)",
"She'd never do anything like that! You hear me?! Never! She's a great kid, and really cute... And really great... And cute.",
"Now, now, let's all be one big happy family, OK?",
"Cry and my whip will accommodate.",
"(What's with her? All she's said for the last few minutes is utter nonsense!)",
"Who are you?",
"I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya…",
"…You worked with Mystic Maya…? You… You're Mr. Nick, right?",
"Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked 'Nick' from…)",
"I know who you are. You're…You're Mystic Maya's… (changes into a happy looks) 'special someone'…",
"So then…Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right?",
"Oh wow…It's like a beautiful fairy tale! That earnest look shining brightly in your eyes... It must be true love…",
"(Takes a blow) Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?)",
"(Regarding Pearl Fey) Aww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter?",
"WH-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?)",
"Have you heard about the murder?",
"It's like, totally scary.",
"(...she says with a silly smile plastered on her face...) So do you know anything about it that might help?",
"...",
"(Somehow, I don't think she has a grip on reality, let alone what's going on here.)",
"Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before...",
"I look forward to tonight's news with great joy, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The image of your face being projected all over the world.",
"All over the world? Looks like you've made a name for yourself.",
"Don't be foolish you foolish fool wearing the foolishly foolish clothes.",
"Don't just stand there 'hmm'-ing to yourself!",
"Not you too, Mia! With the whip… And the pain… And the oww…",
"Th-This…This is preposterous! I…I'm perfect! Me…Franziska von Karma…",
"I'm going to enjoy the news tonight, Ms. von Karma. How about you? It's going to be broadcast all over the world, right? Your defeat, that is…",
"(Out of anger, Franziska whips Phoenix, the Judge and Mimi Miney once, then starts whipping Phoenix multiple times)",
"And one more for good measure!",
"(She whips Phoenix four times, and Phoenix faints)",
"Ph-Phoenix! Hang in there, Phoenix!! PHOENIX!!!",
"This court is a fraud! A sham!",
"*TAKE THAT!* Please look at this!",
"I'm the one who should be sighing Mr Wright, not you!",
"I’m so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship…",
"W-Wait… I… uhh… I mean… We aren’t… Things aren’t like…",
"Usually when people don’t use Mystic Maya’s title, I get mad.",
"O-oh, sorry.",
"But if it’s you Mr. Nick, then it’s OK. Because… Because… you’re “special” to her.",

"Don’t tell me you walked all the way here.",
"Of course not! I ran.",

"Wonderful. Today's special must be Fillet O' Phoenix!",
"Nick? NICK! You're too young to die!",
"I guess putting a poster of a magician in a law office is kinda strange.",
"Baliff, I don't care who it is, smack anyone who's loud in the face! Twice if you must!",
"You still got plenty of time to clean your office later!",
"Ab-so-lute-ly FABULOUS!",
"Absolutely cringe inducing.",
"I wish I was an animal tamer! Nick! Roll over!",
"When this case is over, I'll roll over for you all you want.",
"Who do you think I should go for? Max or Trilo?",
"Wait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet?",
"Uh? I don't care that he's a bit stiff...",
"The burgers dummy!",
"I'm counting on you my sweeties!",
"(He didn't just call me his sweety did he?)",
"I just found it odd... Maximillion Galatica is just a country bumpkin.",
"So? What's wrong with that? He's still a world-class magician.",
"Yeah, but his name is Billy Bob Johns...",
"(Yikes, the guy has 3 first names! That is kind of odd.)",
"(About the bust/statue) It's um... um...",
"What is it? Why did you stop suddenly?",
"(Speaking Slowly)Well, I'm not sure if I should really say this because the bust is... *Whip!* (Speaking much faster) UNDER YOUR HONOUR'S BENCH!!",
"You really had to think about whether you should say tha-",
"GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?!? THAT IS A PENALTY!!",
"Judge What's that? WANT ANOTHER ONE? HERE YOU GO!!",
"Double Arrrgh! (I had a bad feeling that would happen.)",
"Now hurry up and fix things!!",
"ORDER! ORDER! OOORRRDER!! MR. CURLS!!",
"Y-yes, Your Honor?",
"WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL OF THIS!? You are old enough to know better than to behave like this in court!",
"Hey! That's just not right!! That's so harsh!",
"What's not right here is your eyesight and memory, amongst other things!!",
"(silent)...Wh...Why are you being so mean to me!! What did I do!? Lemme guess... you just didn't like my jokes or something, right? You didn't have to go and insult my eyesight or my memory!? They're both great! Seriously!! Why!? Just because you are sitting above me doesn't mean you belong there! And no matter how old I get, I'll always be younger than you!! WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sobs*",
"(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b-)",
"...(Laughing to herself)",
"(...Blast radius of disaster.)",
"Ah, a ladder.",
"It's just a stepladder.",
"What's the difference? They do the same thing, right? I think you should stick to the basic facts of the matter",
"Oh... Uh... Ok. (It's not even worth arguing with her on this one.)",
"Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.",
"Hey! I'm reading that one! You know I'm studying the law now, right? I put that bookmark on the page I was reading... Don't you dare move it!",
"What!? You're reading!? THESE!? A bookmark, huh... Hmm... You mean this thing? It was only on the second page.",
"Well, you have to start somewhere right?",
"You do realise you have 1000 pages to go right?",
"...Maybe you really should sell all these books, Nick.",
"You know, if she wasn't so mean, I think she and I would get along...",
"Yeah, but that's the problem... She is so mean. And that whip... That thing hurts. It really hurts.",
"It is kinda cool though. I wouldn't mind having a whip myself. I bet cracking that whip on you once or twice would be just what the doctor ordered!",
"W-Why me!? W-What did I do!?",
"Whoa. Max used a broken bottle to crack Ben over the head?",
"No no no... It broke because Max cracked Ben over the head with it.",
"He must have really hit him hard then... I guess I should give it a try... For research purposes. Come here... I've got a nice bottle right here for you Nick...",
"Of course it didn't!! You hit me with a plastic bottle!!",
"(about Regent The tiger) It's not dangerous at all, Regent's just a little kitten!",
"(I've seen plenty of kittens... And that's no kitten!)",
"Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.",
"Words can not describe how screwed I am.",
"(Being suprised by Oldbag) Zoinks! It's the Alien!",
"And just like that... the case came to an end. I ran from the courtroom and wandered the streets alone. I never saw Maya again. De Killer is a man of his word, so I'm sure he let Maya go. The trial of Adrian Andrews went ahead and the newspapers read the following headline... Guilty of course. The 'miracle' never happen (sic). Maybe it was never meant to. Because a 'miracle' is something that doesn't exist.",
"(I wonder what happened to that calm and cool composure he had earlier...)",
"So? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?",
"So? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?",
"(Upon learning that one of his witnesses was actually Wendy Oldbag) I saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?",

"This isn't the 'Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour'.",
"(When Judge interrupts Phoenix while he's talking to de Killer) Be quiet and listen... Your Honor.",
"Let's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick!",
"I... I... I am Franziska von Karma. Don't think I'm going to walk in your shadow forever... Our battle... begins now... so you had better prepare yourself, Miles Edgeworth!",
"Mr Engarde, I have one last question for you. Please answer honestly.",
"Please put the phone away and answer the question yourself.",
"Mr Matt Engrade? Isn't he the Nickel Samurai?",
"Yup... I mean no! You've got to say it with more 'umph!' 'The Nickel Samurai!'",
"I will now return to you, your precious item...",
"H-Hey! I'm not an item!",
"(Maya... I thought I'd never see you again... Oh thank goodness!)",
"Shush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!",
"No no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please!",
"T-Then, everything written on this note is meaningless?!",
"Ah! That's it! That's the note!",
"Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Nooooo! You see, this is something completely different. *zoom out* This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!",
"Take a good look at the crime scene photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.",
"Mmm... 'Banana'...",
"Um, his 'bandana', sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.",
"Ah, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.",
"The real mastermind behind this whole murder is… You, Matt Engarde!",
"… … … …*sigh* And here I was, trying to be a good boy for you, dude.",
"I thought if you didn't know, you'd be able to do your job without feeling bad. Well, that's what I thought, anyway…",
"M-Mr. Engarde… You really did hire…!?",
"(turns on wrist communicator) Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult myself, OK? … …",
"(Consult… 'myself'…??)",
"…Well, I guess it's probably about time anyway.",
"About time for what?",
"I think it's time for you to meet him now, Mr. Lawyer dude.",
"(pulls back hair and forms evil grin on face) How do you do… Mister Lawyer? I'm Matt Engarde.",
"That's not something I can answer for you… Wright… Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago… At that time, I didn't truly understand what a 'prosecutor' was. And that is why… I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright… It's your turn.",
"What is this thing called a 'lawyer'? What can you do as one? You must find the answer… And you must find it on your own.",
"I'm a lawyer… But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer… Matt Engarde… That man is really… Argh!",
"It doesn't matter who, every person deserves a proper defense and a fair trial. Isn't that the basis of our judicial system?",
"'Proper defense'? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery?",
"…*sigh* Ironic that you of all people should say such a thing. Isn't that exactly how you have fought for your clients up until now?",
"Uh… W-Well, that may be true, but… But that's… That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal… That… That isn't a proper defense at all! I became a lawyer because I thought… I thought I could save people who were in suffering and in pain… But… When I look at this mess we're in… I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end… I just don't know what to do!",
"… Wright. Would you get a hold of yourself? You have it all wrong.",
"We aren't some sort of heroes. We're only human, you and I. You want to 'save someone'? That's something easier said than done, wouldn't you say? You are a defense lawyer. You can't run away from that. You can only fight. That's all you can do.",
"People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty!",
"… Franziska… She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all.",
"And!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty!",
"… I see… Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken.",
"Thanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record… I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that such things as a perfect win record were meaningless.",
"I don't believe you. Are you saying that's why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now?",
"The answer to that… is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story.",
"For my own personal victories…and for guilty verdicts… I used every dirty trick in the book. And so my win record remained spotless. But… A man appeared and stood fast against that selfish me. I fought him in my usual manner, and tasted my first defeat. I felt like I had lost everything because of that. And then… It was my turn to sit in the defendant's chair. And I was saved…by that person I called my 'enemy'… I couldn't forgive myself for all that had happened. So I left the Prosecutor's Office. And I left that note… 'Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death'…",
"Hmph, as well you should have. A prosecutor who has shamed himself with defeat should crawl into a hole and die!",
"…But that was not what happened. After I left the Prosecutor's Office, I finally came to realize something. And it was in that moment of clarity that everything began to change.",
"We prosecutors use anything we can to attack the defendant. But every time we did so... No matter how desperate the situation, instead of giving up like most people, that man would hold strong with his undying faith. And then, before I knew it… I began to trust in that man as well.",
"Wh-What!? You trusted your enemy!?",
"It doesn't matter how many underhanded tricks a person uses… The truth will always find a way to make itself known. The only thing we can do is to fight with the knowledge we hold and everything we have. Erasing the paradoxes one by one… It's never easy… We claw and scratch for every inch. But we will always eventually reach that one single truth. This I promise you.",
"The 'truth'…",
"Yes. That's the reason why prosecutors and defense lawyers exist. But I'm sure you knew that already, didn't you, Wright?",
"That's why you couldn't forgive me; this man who went into hiding. Isn't that right? This man who only had his sights set on 'victory', who ran away into the night…",
"Ah! Is…Is Mr. Edgeworth right, Mr. Nick…!?",
"(You really let me down…) When you disappeared, I felt…betrayed. The reason I decided to become a lawyer to begin with…was because I believed in the things you said to me, all those years ago… And you…you betrayed your own words. That's why…one year ago, I made up my mind. I decided that the Miles Edgeworth I knew had died… At least, that's what I told myself.",
"You pathetic fool! I don't want to hear the wretched whimpering of a disgraced loser! A Von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth… You are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a Von Karma! And neither am I! It's over… It's all over!",
"Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya and myself are your only two allies in this whole world, but it's all right!",
"(Ouch... I don't really have a lot of friends, do I?)",
"You... who gave you the right to be so high and mighty...!?",
"To the gentleman who spoke just now... Excuse me, but would you care to die?",
"Ah, no! No! I, uh, didn't say anything!",
"Um... Witness. About requesting a hit...",
"... I see you are also quite a dark-hearted man, Mr. Attorney...",
"If you would like to talk business, we can do so after the trial...",
"Ack! NONONO! I'm not thinking of hiring...",
"Y-Y-You... You want to kill me... You want me dead... DON'T YOU!?!?",
"Whaaaat!? Why would you think something like that, Your Hon...",
"Guilty! MR. PHOENIX WRIGHT! You are hereby declared GUILTY!!",
"...Witness. Let's continue...",
"I thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.",
"You? A bodyguard?",
"For your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.",
"M-Mr. Edgeworth?",
"But... 'That sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.' That's what he said to me.",
"If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!",
"'A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!'",
"(... She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)",
"Mr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something bout this racket!?",
"Witness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.",
"OKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?",
"Wright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.",
"(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)",
"Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?",
"Excuse me? 'It'...? What are you...?",
"OBJECTION! Wright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. (hits his desk) Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?",
"Subject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.",
"Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...",
"How else would you get in?! Teleportation?!",
"(Ah, the lamentations of my enemy... how I long for them...)",
"(Boy... this poor kid doesn't have a clue...)",
"It seems Mr. Payne has lost his confidence along with his hair...",
"My HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIRR! IT-IT-IT'S FLYYYYIIING OOOFF!",
"When you find the evidence you need, present it and rub it into old greybeard's face!",
"Yes sir! Into old greybeard's face!",
"Mr. Grossberg! Please try to set a better example for the young lady!",
"A simple question. I thought I'd loosen you up a bit. I am a gentel-man if you will.",
"Mr Wright. you've been lying to me!",
"PLEEEEASE FORGIVE MEEEEE!",
"Mia! You made our client cry!",
"Let him! That 'P' on his shirt doesn't even stand for 'Phoenix' anyway!",
"What did you do with the bottle necklace?",
"F-Forgive me... I... I... I'm sorry...",
"It's OK. Just give back the necklace.",
"... I ate it.",
"... You what?",
"You... You... You ate it...?",
"It was too big to swallow, so I had to chew it into little bits first, but yeah...",
"If anyone says anything rude you can be sure I'll cut them down to size!",
"And I will bash them with my gavel!",
"(I love how they look straight at me when they say that...)",
"Nothing left to do...When a man reaches this age, Sleep is his best friend.",
"(That's supposed to be poetry? Sounds more like a mid-life crisis!)",
"Hmm... So what was it about Mr. Wright that made your heart malfunction like that? In my personal opinion, he just looks like a typical snotty-nosed college brat.",
"Perhaps to a woman your age. But to me, Feenie is handsome!",
"Perhaps to you, Ms. Hawthorne. But to the rest of the planet, he's a dime a dozen.",
"OBJECTION! Love is a mysterious thing, and I object to this line of questioning! If you were to look at my wife, you might all be shocked!",
"He's telling the truth. It was truly, truly shocking.",
"It's not hard to imagine him (Ron) just snapping and screaming 'Please dieeeee!'",
"(A muddy mudskipper in outer space has a better chance of surviving than I do.)",
"I never knew you were such a toilet freak, Nick!",
"...To err is human, to forgive, divine. Humans aren't machines... they have souls, feelings. They live, they die, they love, they hate... And yes, they even make mistakes...",
"Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than hell itself... That is coffee.",
"Men are like colonies of bacteria. The more heat you apply, the faster they grow.",
"Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me!",
"Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...",
"Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him.",
"Times may change but people sadly do not.",
"Let us say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime.",
"Come on! I'm guilty! Throw the book at meeeeeee!",
"(examining part of a sign saying 'bur') Aha, I've got it! Maybe it's supposed to say 'Hamburger'",
"Why would anyone write 'Hamburger' that big?",
"Like, maybe for the 'World Hamburger Festival' or something?",
"Aha, I've got it! Maybe it said, 'Spaghetti?'",
"...Why are you talking about food? Oh, wait. That's normal for you.",
"Anyway, it says, 'bur'. There's no way it could be 'Spaghetti'.",
"Well, maybe it was a typo! It might have said, 'Spaghetti Festival'. What do you think?",
"Ok to me... Besides, Spaghetti is the only thing more tangled than your reasoning.",
"When did you first get that porcupine cut?",
"...Um, it's been like this ever since I was a little kid.",
"What!? You mean that's the way your hair is naturally!? I thought you had some sort of special 'Phoenix Cut' deal with the barber. I mean... You usually only see hair like that in a video game.",
"(Is my hair really that weird-looking?)",
"I'm Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.",
"Yes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?",
"I've never prosecuted a case before",
"N-Never? But you said you've never lost before.",
"...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.",
"Uh... (realize his mistake) No no no no no no no! Th-Th-Th-That's not true!",
"Hmm... For a moment there I thought we'd set the record for the shortest trial ever.",
"*sigh* Well, Mr. DeLite already looks plenty guilty with that face he's making...",
"And once he opens his big mouth he'll probably put the last nail his own coffin.",
"Order Order! Mr Godot! Can you explain this?",
"And stop drinking that coffee!",
"I don't know how to put this, but the guy was a bit of a moneygrubber.",
"Really? Me too! I just love money! I can't ever get enough!",
"(Please, stop leaning towards me like that.. You aren't getting to my wallet.)",
"Anyway, it looks like he did some pretty shifty stuff to earn his millions.",
"Oh! So that's my problem! I think I need to be shiftier!",

"Mr… Um… Mr. Wright?",
"Yes, Your Honor?",
"Wh-What's wrong?!",
"Nothing. It's just… whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... 'Youse talkin' to me?' It was a little, well… intimidating.",
"No, no! That wasn't me! That was the phony Phoenix!",
"I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?",
"('Our trusty'…)",
"So the victim was wearing a HMD?",
"HDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!?",
"(It was none of them actually, but anyway...)",
"Ha! Whether you're a fake or the real deal, we'll find out soon enough.",
"But I can already tell you!! I am the real Phoenix Wright!",
"I wasn't questioning as to whether you were Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you're a real lawyer.",
"(There's no doubt about it. Behind that mask is someone who really hates me for some reason or another.)",

"Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?",

"H-Hey! Give that back! That's mine!!",
"(Too bad, now that you want it I'm not going to part with it.)",
"Why, Mr. Edgeworth... I'm not sure I like you wagging your finger at me as though I were some hoser!",
"Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of all this ballyhoo...!?",
"'To err is human, to forgive, divine.'",
"Did you hear that Ms. Fey? I believe Mr. Edgeworth just called you a canucklehead.",
"I came to see how our little kitten was doing all alone in the big, scary lion's den. ...I thought maybe you'd like someone to play with.",
"The courtroom can be a cold battlefield alright. Especially... for a beginner.",
"But maybe you should keep your claws out, and show them what you've got... Kitten.",
"A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.",
"Mia... Don't you get it? You can't cry yet. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.",
"...Err, umm... So why did you escape anyway?",
"Eeeeek! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!",
"I never... I never lie! I din't escape from nowhere!",
"Err... But, Mr. Fawles... The police just recaptured you two days ago.",
"... Ugh. Sorry. I told a little lie.",
"It's quite obvious that the defendant is guilty.",
"W-Wait a minute! That's not right!",
"At least hear the case before you decide on the outcome, Your Honor!",
"Young people these days simply don't know how to respect their elders.",
"(Why you...! You're even younger than me, you hypocrite!)",
"Hey, ma'am! You got any idea how much work it takes...",
"Wh-What is it?",
"You... Y-You're really gorgeous...",
"Excuse me?",
"No, seriously... My heart... It's aching for you...",
"Detective, I suggest you get back on topic. Otherwise I'll write you on contempt so quickly, something other than your heart will ache.",
"Now then, if the defense is quite done embarassing itself...",
"(Boy would I like to wrap this scarf around his smarmy little neck!)",
"Hey, Kitten... Have you ever put salt in your coffee?",
"It may actually go better with coffee than sugar, right?",
"Listen. My point is if you're not sure, you might as well add a ton of salt to it. It might... bring out the rust in something. Like a piece of evidence.",
"(He's right, Mia... Go present something. You've got nothing to lose!)",
"By the way, I wouldn't put salt in my coffee. The two don't go well, after all.",
"All you have to do is tell us only what you saw.",
"Otherwise the mean lady might yell at you again.",
"(Who is he talking about!?)",
"Dahlia. My girlfriend. My love. My Teen Angel.",
"(Ugh. Did he actually say, 'My Teen Angel'? He's seen one too many soap operas.)",
"Your 'Teen Angel'...? How old was she anyway?",
"F-F-Fourteen!? (I guess you were robbing cradles before diamonds...)",
"'Shichishito'. The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means '7 Branched Sword'. It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear infinite, the choices limitless... like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare.",
"Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?",
"(Now I'm definitely up the creek without a paddle... or a life jacket)",
"(To Godot) Objection! Could you please knock it off with the cheesy proverbs and illogical metaphors already!?",
"Um...The rest of this court doesn't speak Coffeenese. Can you elaborate a bit more?",
"Nnghn! (Did the judge take smart pills during the last recess?)",
"Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV.",
"It's only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives. But what makes us human is that we fight for others.But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...? That's the true measure of what human life is worth.",
"You look like I did after I mistakenly took a swig of Worcestershire sauce.",
"You think maybe my beans are under-roasted, but you have no idea gramps.",
"Cute girls never lie. Ever.",
"People are like books. We've all got a front and a back. You get my drift?",
"I can also say that darkness loves to play with the human mind.",
"There are 253 distinct types of bitterness in coffee... But to pick out each one requires total concentration and the use of all the senses.",
"We can't see the demons that lurk in the night... That's why humans are weak.",
"I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home!",
"Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.",
"Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than hell itself... That is coffee.",
"...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!",
"The truth is... when I was a little boy... I wanted to be a wizard.",
"A fool who doesn't think is more foolish than a fool who foolishly thinks.",
"He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden...",
"Pride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives.",
"You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering, whining wuss of a witness!",
"The guard is glaring at me. 'If someone glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,' is what I was taught.",
"(Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)",
"(... D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)",
"(Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...?)",
"It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people. But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end.",
"(It's not a bad feeling, exposing contradictions like this. Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)",
"('Can I prove it...?' That isn't the issue. To simply 'prove it'. That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!)",
"This is exactly why your salary keeps getting cut!",
"I cannot recommend looking at that sketch. His (Larry's) 'works of art' are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale.",
"I-I'm a spoon?! I'm no spoony bard, I'll have you know!",
"...And what does this word say?",
"That? It says 'roast.' That's kind of a tough word.",
"(Just what kind of book are they reading?)",
"(when seeing the Psyche-Locks for the first time) (W-WHAT IN THE WORLD?!)",
"Um, no. I-It's nothing. (Looks like she's not aware of them herself. This must be what Wright was telling me about... the Psycholocks.)",
"Well, simple is as simple does, they say.",
"Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir!",
"I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.",
"(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)",
"It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?",
"Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.",
"Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!",
"… You know, Edgey… Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.",
"Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!",
"(Grr… This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)",
"(Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?)",
"... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn.",
"Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?",
"Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good.",
"...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health.",
"I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.",
"... Wh-what!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!?",
"Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal!",
"Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!",
"...Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!",
"I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.",
"Hold it!",
"What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth?",
"This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse.",
"So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way.",
"OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a 'lodge', is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right?",
"See? You can do it if you try.",
"Heh heh heh- (whipped) OU-OU-OUCH!",
"So see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, 'crimson lake.' (whipped) ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! (whipped 5 times) Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch!",
"Stop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man!",
"Are..You....High! The girl… She's very high up in this picture!",
"In truth I was shocked. I came back to America with the intention of defeating you. Instead it was my little brother who was leading the defense.",
"(Edgeworth... Come to think of it... Edgeworth was pulled into being a prosecutor by Manfred von Karma as well.)",
"Miles Edgeworth told me something very interesting, you know. He said this case has a special significance to you.",
"And that's precisely why I am here. Your personal involvement will make crushing you into teensy weensy pieces all the better!",
"(It's probably the fever, but... She's so openly hostile that it's almost kinda cute.) *whipped* OWW!",
"No smirking!",
"No whipping the sick!",
"How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?",
"…My, my, my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!",
"I bet your next question is going to be, 'Where exactly did you wash?' Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones…",
"W-What are you going on about!? I was…*gets whipped* Gwah!",
"…Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.",
"The lowest of the low.",
"(Is there some sort of 'Kick Me' sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)",
"A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool. Wouldn't you agree… Phoenix Wright?",
"Eh…? Wait a second…I-I know you.… You're…um… (Gets whipped by her) Oww!",
"Your reflexes and mind need to shape up!",
"(My brain's frying like a sunny-side up and you want me to grill over a name?!)",
"It must be very trying for you, little girl.",
"I am Franziska von Karma. The Prodigy. There's no need to worry now that I'm here.",
"You're the prosecutor who was so mean to Mystic Maya last year.",
"I…I don't like you. You're nothing but a little girl without your whip!",
"Mystic Maya didn't do anything wrong, but you were so mean! I'll never forgive you!",
"(It looks like Pearls' words are getting under her skin…)",
"Yeowwww! Why are you whipping me!? I didn't even say anything!",
"You didn't have to. The smile on your lips gave you away!",
"We're using the department's secret weapon on this!",
"Secret weapon...? What's this secret weapon of yours?",
"You wanna know? You've gotta think scientifically, OK?",
"The murder weapon was a sword. Swords are, scientifically speaking, made of metal, right? Any questions so far?",
"No. (I know what he's gonna say, but I'll let him look smart.)",
"So what's the perfect tool for the job!? Ta-da! A metal detector!",
"(Raise your hand if you didn't see this coming from a mile away...)",
"I already told you… Maya Fey is dead.",
"As they say... 'A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal'.",
"*slams desk* I believe the correct definition of a cornered fox is 'scared and petrified'.",
"… Your animal analogies have grown tiresome!",
"(You were the one who started it!)",
"I'm terribly sorry, but what you heard from someone else simply isn't admissible as testimony.",
"Whaaaaat?! Pearly wouldn't lie! Pearly's a way more honest person than I'll ever be!",
"(Real smart Maya. You always know what to say when you're under oath.)",
"I was the one that failed to protect Mia… …Me and no one else. I tried to avert my eyes from the truth… to escape from the harshness of reality. I just couldn't face Mia's death head on, so I ran! I hid behind a mask. I threw away my true name. I couldn't even deal with being a defense attorney anymore, so I quit.",
"But, but! You saved Maya!",
"Yeah. That was my plan… Up until just now, anyway.",
"Wh-what do you mean?",
"(drinks) Are you listening, Maya? If I had really wanted to save you…then there's one person that I should have gone and talked to right away.",
"Wh-who do you mean? Are you talking about Nick?",
"But I didn't do it… I tried to get the help of Iris and your mother… I closed my eyes to the most important man involved. Do you know why? The real reason?",
"I suppose… I wasn't really interested in saving you at all.",
"I think I was just trying to salvage what's left of my own broken soul… I was trying to make up for the fact that I couldn't save Mia. Nothing more. That's why I let you walk right into a situation that I knew was dangerous. Forgive me…",
"Y-You're wrong! You put your life on the line to save Maya!",
"*shakes his head* Was it really for Maya's sake…? Even I'm not really sure.",
"Wh-What do you mean by that…?",
"That night, in the darkness of the garden, when I saw her silhouette…a part of me must have known it… That it wasn't really Dahlia Hawthorne that was standing there in front of me.",
"It could have been Misty Fey… Or even that little girl. But still, I picked up that blade as though I were in a dream! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in my mind at that point… Was I really motivated by a pure desire to protect Maya Fey? Or was it something else…? Was it hatred for a woman who had stolen everything from me 6 years earlier…? Could it have been simply a desire for revenge? And now, I don't know anything anymore! I did learn something today, however. I finally realized that I was the arrogant one. I was just… chasing an illusion, a fantasy. The stupid fantasy of defeating you in the courtroom…",
"You were the one who taught me that. You never ran away from Mia's death. Instead, you picked up where she left off, as a true defender of the people. In that one moment... I understood everything!",
"Mr. Godot…",
"*shakes his head* I'm sure you already know this…but if you don't… My name is… Diego Armando.",
"M-Mr. Armando! I believe in you! I know you were trying to save me!",
"Y-Your wound…! It's bleeding!",
"...Ha! Did you forget already? In my world, the color red doesn't exist.",
"These must be… my tears.",
"Tears…?",
"Ever since I woke up from my coma… …I think I've been waiting for this very moment.",
"M-Mr. Armando…",
"You'd do well to remember this, Maya. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.",
"I want to… I want to apologize to you.",
"Apologize? To me? For what?",
"For the case six years ago, of course.",
"I just remembered… Weren't you poisoned by your own lover?",
"…Not exactly, but yeah, something like that. Even now… 6 years later, I can hardly believe it. She was going to do it… She was planning to kill me…",
"……It's not all that surprising. The two of you… You hardly knew each other.",
"You and my sister… You only met twice.",
"……Huh. W-We only met t-twice?",
"The first time you met was on that fateful day… The day she poisoned Mr. Armando in the cafeteria of this very courtroom. The next time you met her was… six months later. You met her again on the day that she stole your cold medicine… and Doug Swallows was killed.",
"N-N-No way! It just… It can't be true! I mean, during our whole relationship, we were...",
"……For those six months… …the girl that you thought was Dahlia Hawthorne… She wasn't actually my sister.",
"(Huh? It wasn't Dahlia…?)",
"I hope one day you can forgive me… Feenie.",
"That's right… I lied to you… for six months.",
"B-But why…!? Why would you do such a thing?",
"Ever since she gave you the bottle that day… my sister was trying to get it back as soon as she possibly could. Because of the police investigation and their surveillance… she couldn't move about freely.",
"My sister… From the beginning, she was prepared for the worst.",
"P-Prepared for the worst?",
"She thought that you might discover the truth. That's why she was always ready to deal with you at a moment's notice…",
"(You mean she was ready to kill me, don't you…?)",
"She already had so much to answer for, I didn't want any more sins on her soul. I begged her not to do it, and she agreed to give me a chance.",
"And that's why… you came to me? You came to get the bottle pendant back from me in her place?",
"But I couldn't get you to give it back… I failed at something even as simple as that. Six months passed and I still couldn't get it back from you. Finally, my sister couldn't wait any longer. She didn't consult me about her plans for you that day. …It was the first time that had ever happened.",
"That was a bit strange, wasn't it? Up until that day, you two were partners in crime, and she would confer with you…",
"My feelings for you. If I had found out that she planned to kill you… …I would have done whatever was neccesary to stop her. Even if it meant her life… or mine.",
"I-Iris…!",
"After spending half a year by your side… My feelings for you… They changed.",
"…… I have something to say to you, too.",
"You really are the person I always thought you were. Even after Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty… I still believed in you.",
"It's only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives. But what makes us human is that we fight for others. But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...? That's the true measure of what human life is worth. We defense attorneys are warriors who are constantly challenged by that question. Even when the battle is over, and the bonds that connect us are severed... We always return... Time and time again. Mia, Maya, Pearls, Mr. Armando... and Maya's mother, too... I learned that... from all of them.",
"Isn't violence against hair a crime, Your Honor?",
"Don't worry. I was up at 5 A.M. practicing my 'Chords of Steel!'",
"To think I saw you enter this room a fresh attorney... and now I'll see you leave in chains.",
"Yes, it seems our defense attorney has sunk to an all new low.",
"The defendant took a bottle to the victim... and he hit him!! WHAM! On the head! Out cold!",
"What about me!? Don't I get to prosecute anyone!?",
"No need to worry sir! I'm fine!",
"Ah, and Apollo? You shouldn't say you're fine so much. People might think wrong about you.",
"I was under the impression that you would be heading up the defence today.",
"Well, yes I was Your Honour, but a client's requests must be met and my client specifically asked for Justice.",
"Well of course he wants Justice, but to entrust the case with this greenhorn... I do not exaggerate when I say you're the best defence attorney in town Mr Gavin.",
"(Ok, so Gavin's got experience. Fine. But does he have 'Chords of Steel'..?)",
"Attorneys these days... You don't know your poker?",
"I can't say this bodes well for your career… or your case.",
"(What is this, some kind of secret courtroom poker ring?)",
"Objection! O-B-J-E-C-T-I-O-N!",
"No need to shout, Mr. Justice! I can hear you just fine!",
"Excess yelling can damage the judge's ears… and our case.",
"(B-But what about my Chords of Steel…?)",
"H-hold on just a moment! Where's the witness?",
"I'm surmise that she has been frightened by the defense's demonic-looking horns!",
"(So I used a little hair gel! Relax, people!)",
"Have no fear! If any horns point in your direction this court will cut them off.",
"I swear it on my gavel! Please, come out!",
"Isn't violence against hair a crime, Your Honor?",
"Well done, Apollo. It almost as if you figured it out yourself.",
"Well, I'm just glad I was the one who said it!",
"Because... Mr. Wright can't lose!",
"Um... Apollo? Maybe you could come up with a more legitimate objection?",
"Which indicator in this diagram contradicts what we know about the crime?",
"This indicator has to be wrong!",
"Which indicator is that? I'm not sure I see anything there.",
"...Um... Look closer?",
"Oh yes, I see something there now... Why it's a penalty!",
"The indicator in question is... the victim's!",
"I... see no particular problem with the victim's location.",
"Ah, good. That's good to know.",
"No, it's not! Penalty!",
"What doesn't make sense is the witness!",
"Ms Olga Orly? Wasn't she unconscious at the time?",
"...Erm, yes. I suppose she was.",
"I fail to see how an unconscious witness can contradict anything. Yet this conscious Judge can penalize you, and he just did!",
"You mean to say I don't make sense?",
"N-No! Of course you do s-sir!",
"Here's what I want you to do, Trucy. Take that memory, gently lock it away deep in your heart, and never speak of it.",
"(Why does he have to be so... cool?)",
"(Fine. Ignore my evidence. See if I care. ...I wonder what he's think- On second thoughts, let's not go there.)",
"(W-What's that?)",
"Ah, 'presenting' are we? I used to do a fair share of that myself.",
"*Looks at attorney badge* What's that? It looks strangely familiar...",
"Tell me you share my angst, Herr Forehead.",
"A glaring contradiction to be sure... More glaring than your forehead!",
"Achtung baby! Today we play it my way!",
"Is that... woman underwear?",
"Too many brides these days can't even weave baskets blindfolded... underwater.",
"Let's see... PANTIES!! Again!?",
"Move along or I may spill something on your face. Want a dose of experimental Hydroxyacelunodosetrase?",
"Quiet please... It's snack time.",
"Oh hey! An attorney badge? My Daddy has one of those too. Here, give that to me a second. Now if I do this... and this... ta da!",
"Ack! My badge! Bring it back!",
"Don't worry, just check your pocket.",
"My pocket! (T-There's something in there!) ...This is... the flyer for your talent agency?!",
"And here's your badge. You can have it back now.",
"That's the last time I let her touch anything of mine. Period.",
"There's something that, well, it doesn't sit right. I just can't believe you have a daughter, Mr. Wright! And... she's so big! Not fat, but, er, you know what I mean.",
"Oh, Trucy's still a child.",
"Daddy! How many times do I have to remind you! I'm not a child anymore!",
"Ah ha ha! But you'll always be Daddy's little baby girl to me, Trucy.",
"(Ah ha ha! My foot! I'm not buying it.)",
"Alright! Let's see if we can find some clues. Clues for finding a panty snatcher! Clues... like a pair of panties!",
"Um... Trucy. Could you stop saying panties so much, please?",
"The evidence that shows why he lied...is this.",
"What? More panties?!",
"How many panties are you carrying in your pocket, Herr Forehead?",
"These are the last!! Honest!!",
"*presenting Trucy's panties to Phoenix* We found these too. They're Trucy's.",
"Good job, Apollo. But as a father, I have to wonder why you're still carrying around Trucy's panties in your pocket.",
"(Ack! That'll teach me to show evidence to Mr Wright!)",
"Ack! Don't touch Mr Charley!",
"'Mister' Charley...?",
"He's been in this office much longer than I have! Daddy's mentor had a great fondness for Mr Charley. He's lived here ever since Daddy was a rookie attorney.",
"Huh. (Mr Charley... riiight.)",
"That's one of those hula hoop things everyone was crazy about way back when.",
"Really? I had no idea they were that popular!",
"I'm not so bad with one myself, actually.",
"Eh!? I-I'm still learning... So you can really make someone levitate with it? Show me!",
"Huh!? I-I have no idea how! (It's just a normal hula hoop, isn't it?)",
"That table... doesn't look very sturdy.",
"You've never seen one of these? It's a magic table!",
"So, like, you make this teapot disappear?",
"So you might think! But that's not it... Before your very eyes, the contents of the pot change! ...From Earl Grey to Darjeeling!",
"Kinda hard to see the difference I'd think...",
"Little Plum? That's a really cute name for someone so...",
"Yes...? *draws sword from broom*",
"What is it Apollo?",
"How about you go through me when talking to her, OK, Trucy?",
"Huh? That seems like a bit of a needless procedure.",
"I'm a lawyer. I live for needless procedures.",
"Looks like there's some trouble by the park gate.",
"I smell an incident!",
"Ma'am! There's no entry to the park!",
"Now don't you tell me where I can't go, young fella! *climbing over hedge* I always walk through this park on my way home!",
"Please, get down from there! You'll hurt yourself, ma'am!",
"(That's quite the determined old lady...)",
"T... Trucy! You're OK! I-I thought... *sniff* *sob* *bawl*",
"D-Don't cry Apollo!",
"Grr... Those good for nothing gangsters, there are some things you just don't do! I'm pressing charges!",
"Wait! Just calm down, Apollo. Or else...",
"* Trucy presses a button and Mr Hat appears*",

"Suprised? This is one of my best tricks! The Amazing Mr Hat!",
"'You look mahvelous, dahling!'",
"He's a big hit on stage at the Wonder Bar.",
"'Yes. I am a big hit. Ha ha ha.'",
"Well, what do ya think? Do ya like it?",
"You mean you... Trucy! There are some things you just don't do! I...I'm pressing charges!",
"So Mr. Meraktis was your rival?",
"...You like those onions they put in the soup broth?",
"Um, yeah, kind of.",
"You take a spoon, you drink some broth... Those onions will find their way in there. For people who like 'em, why that's just fine. For people who hate 'em... ...I hate onions. Hate 'em! Always sneaking in from the side, gettin' in the way of a good tastin' spoonful. Well, that's what he was. An onion! Onion-boy, that's what I called 'im.",
"So... you weren't exactly friends.",
"This is proof of why the car broke down that night!? Well, Prosecutor Gavin?",
"Ah, it's proof of a malfunction, alright... A malfunction in Herr Forehead's brain.",
"The court accepts this evidence! (Penalty)",
"(Who would have imagined me here... ...at a Gavinners concert, watching Prosecutor Gavin 'rock'.)",
"(C'mon. Can't I be cool for once!?)",
"I should have learnt to play the guitar. 'Chords of Steel' aren't very romantic.",
"But I'm a lawyer! I'm not supposed to be nice!",
"Sounds like they're having a spat. One of those 'differences in musical direction' bands are always splitting up over.",
"How can you call someone as good as Machi a 'pianist'? Why, that's like throwing him in the same class as Daddy!",
"I play new rock, not Great Balls of Fire! Speaking of fire, I have a good mind to fire whoever's responsible!",
"Herr Forehead, save your wild accusations for the court. I do so enjoy the penalties.",
"The only thing wrong with Herr Forehead is his massive forehead.",
"Someday you'll come to understand... the importance of thinking for yourself.",
"Call me Ema. There's no need for titles once you've shared a bottle of fingerprinting powder!",
"Why can't we have a normal, straightforward killing once in awhile in this country!?",
"(About a code number left by victim) Wait, what if the killer was a robot?",
"You know... just for a moment there... you were cool.",
"Um... Ema?",
"(She Snackoo'd me...)",
"Um, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those.",
"You'll be wanting for a long time on your salary.",
"Wait till you're as famous as Mr. Wright was, then dream.",
"I don't think Daddy was ever rich, even when he was in law.",
"Great, just stomp on my dreams, why don't you.",
"Yeah, but I'm a girl! I'm supposed to swoon over gods of rock!",
"God-awful, maybe.",
"Come to think of it, I'm a little thirsty...",
"I'll have some tea.",
".........I think I'll have the water-",
"(cuts in) I'll take a tea!",
"If you want tea that badly, buy some yourself!",
"Trucy Ooh! Apollo! Can I have some of that fruit please?",
"Absoluetly not!",
"Yeah, yeah I know. But still I yearn!",
"Well, you're not the only one eyeing that fruit!",
"So what are we waiting for? Let's eat!",
"Woah! Woah! Woah! Are you two crazy? Ema you should know better.",
"But s-she tempted me... She's a temptress!",
"(Please grow up...)",
"Look at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.",
"I got a present once, from a person in the audience.",
"That's pretty cool.",
"Isn't it! Maybe you'll get one someday. ...From someone you defend!",
"(That's called getting paid, and I certainly hope I do.)",
"It...It was a great concert.",
"You heard me sing? Thank you.",
"I was hoping to get an autograph later, actually...",
"Of course.",
"Mr. Justice. This is a cross-examination! You're out of line! If anyone deserves an autograph here, it's me. One of my gavel would be nice.",
"Herr Judge. (Toss an autograph of himself to the judge)",
"It's my autograph. Now keep this trial moving.",
"Wh-What!? Oh, my grandchild will be so happy!",
"(Apparently, his grandson is a big fan...)",
"Well, what did you say for yourself?",
"..She says 'English is very difficult'.",
"That trick's not going to work here.",
"That's one of the biggest expensive-looking TV's I've ever seen.",
"Too bad you'll never own one.",
"'Never's kind of harsh, Trucy.",
"Hmm. How about 'for all eternity' then?",
"Huh, another ladder",
"Actually, it's technically a stepladder.",
"Well hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.",
"I'm less worried about the ladder, and more worried about why it's there.",
"(Why is the ladder there?)",
"(Well, to climb, right? To reach something on the ceiling?)",
"You know, my Daddy isn't very good with heights.",
"Yeah, he took me on this big Ferris Wheel once. Halfway to the top he turned green and kept mumbling 'objection' over and over again.",
"Borginian Customs is very thorough. Everything and everyone gets checked.",
"*HOLD IT!* Just how strict is this customs check?",
"Way strict. They keep planes on the ground for hours.",
"I do recall it being a bit extreme. They were even confiscating gumdrops and marshmallows.",
"Yes... It would be hard to distinguish between them (Borginian Cocoons)",
"(That's right. Gavin was in Borginia, wasn't he.)",
"I remember setting off the metal detector several times. I had to practically strip naked to walk through.",
"Leave the bling at home, you glimmerous fop.)",
"'Attorney Utterly Confused', end quote.",
"Or 'I Still Have No Idea What You're Talking About', end quote, I might say.",
"('Judge Has Active Imagination'... end quote.)",
"Believe me, any comic relief I may provide is entirely unintentional.",
"(I didn't lose, I was merely ascertaining the facts... so why am I so annoyed?!)",
"(I think our friendly neighbourhood Mr Hat just gave me a heart attack...)",
"'OBJECTION!' I can't help it, there's something about this model's pose that makes me yell that. I've got to get over it... I know! I'll pretend it's saying something else. 'Why yes! The post office is over there! Good day sir!'",
"Sometimes Life Just sucks",
"(Their debut single was just 2 minutes and 15 seconds long? What a rip-off!)",
"(See that innocent smile? Everyone has a different way of breaking the news.)",
"Welcome back to reality! We've been waiting for you.",
"Well we know the motive for the killer now, except the killer would be you Herr Judge and the victim would be Herr Forehead!",
"'Logical'? I do not think this word means what you think it means, Herr Forehead!",
"The law is 'absolute'...? You can't be serious.",
"...Finally. You just couldn't resist, could you Herr Wright..?",
"What possible conclusion do you think this 'investigation' of yours can lead to? I killed a man named 'Smith' with a bottle because I am an evil human being. ...Isn't that enough?",
"Well, well, well. Whoever heard of a thief in jail?",
"Owning the same nail polish does not a murderer make.",
"Have you ever thought, all those spikes protect it's top but what about underneath it?",
"(Must remember to keep Trucy away from small, round fish...)",
"Can you tell me more about Zak Gramayre?",
"Daddy? Sure thing Daddy!",
"(Which Daddy was that again?)",
"Here goes! Give us an impression, Mr. Hat!",
"That wasn't very good, and besides I prefer Ms. Magic Underwear...",
"That's Magic Panties Apollo!!",
"Many boys and girls joined the police because of that pistol, I hear.",
"(You know, that would explain a lot about the police force.)",
"Alaka.....alaka......ALAKAZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMG",
"You say the funniest things with a straightest face!",
"...People always tell me that. (Except I wasn't joking.)",
"You fail to grasp the concept of 'questioning', detective (Detective Gumshoe).",
"You fail to grasp the concept of 'shooting people is bad', detective.",
"I believe the correct term here is 'You fail!'",
"I have no real interest in the perceived worth of other people. As for my own worth, that is something only I can determine for myself.",
"I'm just a lowly detective so... I'm not sure what to do with that, other than arrest it!",
"I'm just a lowly security guard so... I'm not sure what to do with that, other than guard it!",
"...Is this... yet another batch of fresh flowers...?",
"The ones that come with a card attached every month like clockwork for you? Yup. Speaking of that! Let's see what's on the card this month, sir! 'All will be resolved. --Wendy'",
"(Oh, Ms. Irony. How painful are thy thorns.)",
"Wendy... Isn't that the name of that old lady with the whiny voice that's stalk--",
"That's enough, Detective. You need not remind me further. *shudder*",
"(Knowing her, the only kind of talking she likes to do is with her whip. Plus, I doubt the top-secret part was what stopped her from talking to you, Detective.)",
"(About Meele's sleeping on duty) (How has this woman not been fired yet?)",
"Foolish reasoning for a foolish fool from a foolishly foolish fool meant to fool me…",
"It's a movie poster for... 'License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder'...",
"That's an iFly Airlines sponsored movie. It's a suspense-hardboiled-action-romance-horror-comedy movie.",
"...Is that the genre listing for this movie?",
"Yes. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone because it encompasses all those genres!",
"I can't even begin to imagine what the plot of this movie would be like.",
"But you have to admit it piqued your curiousity right? I heard the main strategy with this genre listing was to make people curious.",
"Well then, consider the mission a successful one.",
"Excuse me, but may I have a word with you?",
"...............*yawn* ....If you need something, please ask Ms. Rhoda over there, OK?",
"What the....Hey! Wake up, you!",
"I'm terribly sorry that she's being so rude, Mr.Edgeworth.",
"No need for you to apologize. I just find it hard to believe she's asleep on the job! (If I were her boss I'd see to it that her salary was cut so low that it was in the red.)",
"What's a lifesaver doing here... ?",
"I-I-I bought it a-at the in-f-f-flight shop just be-beyond the lounge! If-If something sh-should happen, having o-o-one will s-save your life!",
"(I think this guy would've been better off not taking the plane to begin with.)",
"Ah that's right. I was in the middle of recreating a chess game.",
"Just an observation, but aren't there too many red knights around that lone blue pawn?",
"Nonsense. It simply shows that the blue pawn is no match for the red knight's might.",
"That leads to the emergency escape hatch. You can't go there in mid-flight.",
"What's the probability the criminal escaped through here?",
"...........Oh! Let me finish my thought. I'm 100% certain they didn't.",
"(When I'm searching for an answer, only complete thoughts need apply.)",
"(These counter windows offer a glimpse of the sky, but these clouds, they tell me nothing.)",
"Mr Edgeworth..? You... look like you're talking to the clouds.",
"Is that so? Then tell me, what do you suppose I said to them?",
"I don't know, but it looked like a rather one-sided conversation.",
"(The clouds... they tell me nothing.)",
"Hmph! Don't number the birds before they are born!",
"(Don't number the... What...? I have no idea what he's trying to say. 'Don't count your chicken before they hatch' perhaps...?)",
"Hm? Looking from behind.... I think I've seen this man somewhere before...",
"OM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM! In Soviet Russia, World Flags Lunchboxe eat j00! Urrrr....Nnnn....F... (>_<;) Found it! LAWL!! Ooh! I feel a wave of CR34T1V3 POW3RZ coming ON! It's over 9000!!! LULZ! For my next L33T movie, it's gonna be 'The Steel Champion of the Earth'! It's gonna r0x0rz so many b0x0rz!",
"So the Steel Samurai is finally getting a movie...",
"Hey, Mr Edgeworth, I think something just fell out of your pocket.",
"S-So did something fall out or not? I didn't, um, get a good look, sir!",
"...It doesn't concern you, so don't worry about it. (My Prosecutor's Badge of all things! Gumshoe must never know that I dropped it!)",
"What did I ever do to deserve this... ? More than this job, all I truly love is my sweet Cammy!",
"(Might I suggest you not to say that at this moment in front of Franziska... ?)",
"If I may have a word with you, Ms. Meele...",
"No, you may not have a word with me. I don't want to talk to any other man except for the captain right now.",
"Me, too, Cammy! I...I will never talk to another woma.... (gets whiped by Franziska) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!",
"(This definitely looks like a job for Franziska.)",
"Franziska, I'd like to ask you about the investigation...",
"Miles Edgeworth. Can't you see that I'm in the middle of taking his statement? This man is the only captain in title. I'm going to teach him to do his job properly. (Whips the captain)",
"OWW!! OK, OK! From now on, I'll keep my focus and take my responsibilities seriously!",
"He's really trembling there...",
"If it makes him to take his job seriously, it's not such a bad thing, is it?",
"Wh-Why are you looking at me like that, sir!?",
"M-Mr. Edgeworth! What is this super-expensive-looking feast of Jurassic proportions?",
"It's just the food they serve in First Class",
"Wow! I am so jealous, sir! I wanna ride in First Class sometime!",
"(Right... When pigs fly and I own my own private jet...)",
"Wow! You read law books even when you're flying sir!?",
"Were you expecting anything less? Now come along, we must hurry to the crime scene!",
"Hm? Hold on a sec... There's a different book stuck in here. 'The Steel Samurai's Adv...'",
"Detective Gumshoe! Am I going to have to charge you with invasion of privacy?!",
"Ms. Meele. Wake up!",
"*yawn* I'm awake, I'm awake........................zzz.",
"Miles Edgeworth. I demand that you do something about this flight attendant this instant!",
"(Why ask me to wake her when you can finally put that whip to an appropiate use?)",
"Ms. Meele! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Wake up!",
"*yawn* I'm awake, I'm awake........................zzz.",
"(Finally snaps and whip at her but hits Gumshoe instead)",
"Yeowch!! Wh-What did you whip me for, siiir!?",
"Ooh, what did I miss?",
"(A poor detective being on the receiving end of a lash in your stead.)",
"(Today has gone beyond from the typical 'not my day' into the realm of 'walking nightmare'!)",
"(Badger, badger, badger, badger ... Just what does she see in these silly things?)",
"(Nooooo! Why HER!? Why HERE!? Why NOW!?)",
"Every pack has its own rules.",
"On truth's path, the word 'probability' does not exist.",
"Oh, come on. It wasn't that hard to see that coming, even for a layman like me!",
"You know she reminds of? A cartoon character!",
"Badger GET!",
"There is clearly...",
"... A contradiction here!",
"Please stop stealing my lines!",
"Kids... can sometimes be so cruel...",
"(This is what some people may say is the pot calling the kettle black]...)",
"Your Honor, I'm sorry but... I cannot allow you to not allow me to make an objection!",
"(Ack! My eyes have locked with my reflection's eyes in the barrel window! As a student of Von Karma, I refuse to back down!).............I won.",
"Hmm, a drink vending machine................ Ack! (Now is not the time to be pondering what kind of drink I want!)",
"Wh-What a completely foolish line of foolish thought from a thoroughly foolish fool!",
"Not happy with committing just murder, he had to go and dirty the courthouse too!? GUILTY!",
"Egads, I've been overruled?!",
"My eyes are as sharp as can be! Ready to see through lies to the truth! Although, recently, things do seem to become a bit fuzzier than they used to be...",
"(Clearly his eyes aren't the only thing to go fuzzy!)",
"*OBJECTION!* That statement contradicts this evidence!",
"Your Honor, by my account... there is absolutely no contradiction here at all.",
"R-R-R-REALLY!? *nods* Well then, I guess we're still alright. Please continue the testimony.",
"The two of them overruled me!?",
"*OBJECTION!*",
"Overruled!!",
"(Egad...! What a cold stare he's giving me! However, as a disciple of Von Karma, there is no option but to win!) ..................!",
"Perhaps the Yatagarasu is in the business of stealing people's lives?",
"........ You are not very funny, or witty, are you, little Miss von Karma?",
"Franziska! Be careful about who you whip! Choose carefully, or we may be sued by... (Franziska whips Edgeworth) Nnghhoooh!",
"There. I chose carefully, just like you wanted.",
"Ahah... Ahahahahahahahahaha! Th-That just now... was hilarious, little missy!",
"Hmph. Of course it was.",
"(.......What is wrong with these two women!? Why does my pain give them delight?)",
"So that window on the other side belongs to the men's restroom...",
"... I can't see it.",
"At your height? I'm not surprised.",
"Nnghoooooooh! (I guess short people have feelings too!)",
"I see you have no mercy for the elderly either, Franziska.",
"Hmph. Don't talk back to me, unless you want to be whipped in the back.",
"(With your height, you'd need a step-ladder or four to accomplish that)",
"I'll be the judge for that, Detective Gumshoe.",
"No, you won't! I'll be the judge of that!",
"No, no, no, no, no. I'M the judge around here! And I'LL be the judge of that!",
"How about we use this handkerchief to dry your little eyes?",
"(Kay goes up to Edgeworth and blows her nose in his cravat)",
"Nnnnghooooooh! My cravat! Don't blow your nose on that!",
"I believe that's a hill of ants.",
"Oooh... That detective...! He claims that not a single slipped by him and yet, there is a whole hill of them!",
"Gnaaack! Wh-What are you hitting ME for!?",
"As a replacement for that pathetic detective!",
"(There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man. When a person goes beyond that limit, then the law, too, crosses into new territory! For what reason were laws invented? The answer to that is what I must now show!)",
"H-How could this happen two days in a roooooooooooow!?",
"Larry, you do realize that Santa Claus does not exist? ...Then you will also realize this. If Santa was real he'd be the biggest unlawful trespasser in history!",
"I want you to answer this question honestly, and depending on your answer, I may let you live...",
"OBJECTION! Go away!",
"...HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWL!!",
"Quit screwin' around! I have no sympathy for someone who would pass the guilt on to a dead man!",
"The reason people judge people is because people are people.",
"Before aiming for the throat, chew the neck shield off first.",
"....................Just go already!",
"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.",
"Alright... but if what she says is a waste of time... I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl 'Nooooooooooooooo!'",
"Hmph... as you wish.",
"What is this plant supposed to be?",
"Franziska, can't you see that it's supposed to be a likeness of Ambassador Alba?",
"Miles Edgeworth! As a subordinate, you have a lot of nerve telling me what to think! I look forward to your next salary assessment next month.",
"(You are deluding yourself if you think you have any control over that!)",
"Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!?",
"Hm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece.",
"What's going on? And why are you beet-red?",
"Sorry, but could you not speak to me now?",
"Yeah, and trust me, I know a real fan when I see one, because I'm the Steel Samurai!",
"OBJECTION! I will never acknowledge you as the true Steel Samurai!",
"Oh! One last thing before I go! Let's take a group photo, just the three of us!",
"Yeah, a commemorative photo! Every big case has to end with one!",
".................No.",
"Don't tell me you're camera shy, Mr. Edgeworth!",
"O-Of course not, Detective!",
"Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm taking the picture now!",
"Mr. Edgeworth! You can't run away from this, sir!",
"Ack! Hey! Detective Gumshoe! S-Stop that! I can't be seen doing... that!" ];
